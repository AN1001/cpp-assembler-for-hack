# cpp-assembler-for-hack
An assembler for the HACK assembly language that translates from .asm to raw binary for the HACK virtual machine

To run on your own computer, download the cpp file
and edit line ```41``` with the path from your working directory
to the folder that contains your .asm (HACK) files.

Then compile the cpp file with any modern cpp compiler and run the executable.

Enter the file name and the assembler will output the corresponding HACK machine code
